"Modern Web browsers try to keep us safe, and so they blast us with scary "
"warnings when sites have the smallest errors in their SSL certificates, "
"or when they use self-signed SSL certificates. ownCloud admins encounter "
"this when creating Federation shares, or setting up external storage "
"mounts. There is no reason against using self-signed certificates on your"
" own networks; they're fast, free, and easy."

"ownCloud has several methods for importing self-signed certificates so "
"that you don't have to hassle with Web browser warnings. When you allow "
"your users to create their own external storage mounts or Federation "
"shares, they can import SSL certificates for those shares on their "
"Personal pages."

" Certificate** button, then keep going until you can download it. In "
"Firefox and Chromium there is an **Export** button for downloading your "
