"If you have a filesystem mounted with 200,000 files and directories and "
"15 snapshots in rotation, you would now scan and process 200,000 elements"
" plus 200,000 x 15 = 3,000,000 elements additionally. These additional "
"3,000,000 elements, 15 times more than the original quantity, would also "
"be available for viewing and synchronisation. Because this is a big and "
"unnecessary overhead, most times confusing to clients, further processing"
" can be eliminated by using excluded directories."
