"You can significantly improve your ownCloud server performance with "
"memory caching, where frequently-requested objects are stored in memory "
"for faster retrieval. There are two types of caches to use: a PHP opcode "
"cache, which is commonly called *opcache*, and data caching for your Web "
"server. If you do not install and enable a local memcache you will see a "
"warning on your ownCloud admin page. **A memcache is not required and you"
" may safely ignore the warning if you prefer.**"
