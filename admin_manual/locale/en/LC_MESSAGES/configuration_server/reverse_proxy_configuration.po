"For security, you must explicitly define the proxy servers that ownCloud "

"Set the **trusted_proxies** parameter as an array of IP address to define"
" the servers ownCloud should trust as proxies. This parameter provides "
"protection against client spoofing, and you should secure those servers "
"as you would your ownCloud server."

"A reverse proxy can define HTTP headers with the original client IP "
"address, and ownCloud can use those headers to retrieve that IP address. "
"ownCloud uses the de-facto standard header 'X-Forwarded-For' by default, "
"but this can be configured with the **forwarded_for_headers** parameter. "
"This parameter is an array of PHP lookup strings, for example 'X"
"-Forwarded-For' becomes 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'. Incorrectly setting this "
"parameter may allow clients to spoof their IP address as visible to "
"ownCloud, even when going through the trusted proxy! The correct value "
"for this parameter is dependent on your proxy software."

"If ownCloud fails to automatically detect the hostname, protocol or "
"webroot you can use the **overwrite** parameters inside the "
":file:`config/config.php`. The **overwritehost** parameter is used to set"
" the hostname of the proxy. You can also specify a port. The "
"**overwriteprotocol** parameter is used to set the protocol of the proxy."
" You can choose between the two options **http** and **https**. The "
"**overwritewebroot** parameter is used to set the absolute web path of "
"the proxy to the ownCloud folder. When you want to keep the automatic "
"detection of one of the three parameters you can leave the value empty or"
" don't set it. The **overwritecondaddr** parameter is used to overwrite "
"the values dependent on the remote address. The value must be a **regular"
" expression** of the IP addresses of the proxy. This is useful when you "
"use a reverse SSL proxy only for https access and you want to use the "
"automatic detection for http access."
