"A system like ownCloud sometimes requires tasks to be done on a regular "
"basis without the need for user interaction or hindering ownCloud "
"performance. For that purpose, as a system administrator, you can define "
"background jobs (for example, database clean-ups) which are executed "
"without any need for user interaction."

#: ../../configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration.rst:5
msgid ""
"These jobs are typically referred to as *cron jobs*.  Cron jobs are "
"commands or shell-based scripts that are scheduled to run periodically at"
" fixed times, dates, or intervals.   ``cron.php`` is an ownCloud internal"
" process that runs such background jobs on demand."

"ownCloud plug-in applications register actions with ``cron.php`` "
"automatically to take care of typical housekeeping operations, such as "
"garbage collecting of temporary files or checking for newly updated files"
" using ``filescan()`` for externally mounted file systems."

"You can schedule cron jobs in three ways -- using AJAX, Webcron, or cron."
" The default method is to use AJAX.  However, the recommended method is "
"to use cron.  The following sections describe the differences between "
"each method."

"The AJAX scheduling method is the default option.  Unfortunately, "
"however, it is also the least reliable. Each time a user visits the "
"ownCloud page, a single background job is executed. The advantage of this"
" mechanism is that it does not require access to the system nor "
"registration with a third party service. The disadvantage of this "
"mechanism, when compared to the Webcron service, is that it requires "
"regular visits to the page for it to be triggered."
