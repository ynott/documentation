"You can configure your ownCloud server to automatically run a virus scan "
"on newly-uploaded files with the Antivirus App for Files. The Antivirus "
"App for Files integrates the open source anti-virus engine `ClamAV "
"<http://www.clamav.net/index.html>`_  with ownCloud. ClamAV detects all "
"forms of malware including Trojan horses, viruses, and worms, and it "
"operates on all major file types including Windows, Linux, and Mac files,"
" compressed files, executables, image files, Flash, PDF, and many others."
" ClamAV's Freshclam daemon automatically updates its malware signature "
"database at scheduled intervals."

"ClamAV runs on Linux and any Unix-type operating system, and Microsoft "
"Windows. However, it has only been tested with ownCloud on Linux, so "
"these instructions are for Linux systems. You must first install ClamAV, "
"and then install and configure the Antivirus App for Files on ownCloud."

"The installer automatically creates default configuration files and "

"This installs two configuration files: ``/etc/freshclam.conf`` and "
