"Since ownCloud 9.0.3 you need to explicitly configure and enable index"
".php-less URLs (e.g. https://example.com/apps/files/ instead of "
"https://example.com/index.php/apps/files/). The following documentation "
"provides the needed steps to configure this for the ``Apache`` Web "
"server. These steps are not necessary when using nginx as a web server "

"Before being able to use index.php-less URLs you need to enable the "

"applied :ref:`strong_perms_label` the user might be unable to write into "
