"The External sites app is included in all versions of ownCloud. Go to "
"**Apps > Not Enabled** to enable it. Then go to your ownCloud Admin page "
"to create your links, which are saved automatically. There is a dropdown "
"menu to select an icon, but there is only one default icon so you don't "
"have to select one. Hover your cursor to the right of your links to make "
"the trashcan icon appear when you want to remove them."

"Your links may or may not work correctly due to the various ways that Web"
" browsers and Web sites handle HTTP and HTTPS URLs, and because the "
"External Sites app embeds external links in IFrames. Modern Web browsers "
"try very hard to protect Web surfers from dangerous links, and safety "
"apps like `Privacy Badger <https://www.eff.org/privacybadger>`_ and ad-"
"blockers may block embedded pages. It is strongly recommended to enforce "
"HTTPS on your ownCloud server; do not weaken this, or any of your "
"security tools, just to make embedded Web pages work. After all, you can "
"freely access them outside of ownCloud."

"Most Web sites that offer login functionalities use the ``X-Frame-"
"Options`` or ``Content-Security-Policy`` HTTP header which instructs "
"browsers to not allow their pages to be embedded for security reasons "
"(e.g. \"Clickjacking\"). You can usually verify the reason why embedding "
"the website is not possible by using your browser's console tool. For "
"example, this page has an invalid SSL certificate."
