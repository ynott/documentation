"LDAP User Cleanup is a new feature in the ``LDAP user and group backend``"
" application. LDAP User Cleanup is a background process that "
"automatically searches the ownCloud LDAP mappings table, and verifies if "
"the LDAP users are still available. Any users that are not available are "
"marked as ``deleted`` in the ``oc_preferences`` database table. Then you "
"can run a command to display this table, displaying only the users marked"
" as ``deleted``, and then you have the option of removing their data from"
" your ownCloud data directory."
