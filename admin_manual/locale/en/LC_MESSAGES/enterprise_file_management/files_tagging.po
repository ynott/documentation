"New in ownCloud 9.0, the Workflow App provides advanced management of "
"file tagging. The app has three parts: Tag Manager, Automatic Tagging, "
"and Retention."

"The Workflow App should be enabled by default (Apps page), and the three "
"configuration modules visible on your ownCloud Admin page."

"See `Tagging Files "
"<https://doc.owncloud.com/server/9.2/user_manual/files/access_webgui.html>`_"

msgid "Tag Manager"
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:18
msgid ""
"The Tag Manager is for creating new tags, editing existing tags, and "
"deleting tags. Tags may be marked as **Visible**, **Restricted**, or "
"**Invisible**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Visible** means that all users may see, rename, and apply these tags to"
" files and folders."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Restricted** means tags are assignable and editable only to the user "
"groups that you select. Other users can filter files by restricted tags, "
"but cannot tag files with them or rename them. The tags are marked "
"(restricted)."
msgstr ""

"This is what your tags look like in the **Tags** view on your files page."
" Non-admin users will not see invisible tags, but they will see visible "

msgid "Automatic Tagging"
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:40
msgid ""
"The Automatic Tagging module operates on newly-uploaded files. Create a "
"set of conditions, and then when a file or folder matches those "
"conditions it is automatically tagged. The tag must already have been "
"created with the Tag Manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:45
msgid ""
"For example, you can assign the invisible tag **iOS Uploads** to all "
"files uploaded from iOS devices. This tag is visible only to admins."

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:62
msgid ""
"The Retention module is your housecleaning power tool, because it "
"automatically deletes files after a time period that you specify. Select "
"which tag to set a time limit on, and then set your time limit. File age "
"is calculated from the file mtime (modification time)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:70
msgid ""
"For best performance, retention tags should be applied high in your file "

"**TagBasedRetention** is the default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:81
msgid ""
"**TagBasedRetention**: This checks files that have a particular tag "
"assigned. Then it checks (depth-first) the children of the tagged item, "
"before continuing with the other tagged items. Children that have already"
" been checked will not be checked a second time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:86

"This is optimised for processing smaller numbers of files that have "
"multiple retention tags."
msgstr ""

#: ../../enterprise_file_management/files_tagging.rst:89
msgid ""
"**UserBasedRetention**: Examines files per user. It first iterates over "
"all files and folders (siblings first), then examines the tags for those "
"items and checks their respective retention periods. This is optimised "
"for many files with few retention tags."
