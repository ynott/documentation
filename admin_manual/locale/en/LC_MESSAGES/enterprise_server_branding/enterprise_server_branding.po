"ownBrander is an ownCloud build service that is exclusive to Enterprise "
"edition customers for creating branded ownCloud clients and servers. You "
"may brand your ownCloud server using ownBrander to easily build a custom "
"theme, using your own logo and artwork. ownCloud has always been theme-"
"able, but it was a manual process that required editing CSS and PHP "
"files. Now Enterprise customers can use ownBrander, which provides an "
"easy graphical wizard."
