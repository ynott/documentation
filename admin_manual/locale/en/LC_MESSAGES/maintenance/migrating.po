"If the need arises ownCloud can be migrated to a different server. A "
"typical use case would be a hardware change or a migration from the "
"virtual appliance to a physical server. All migrations have to be "
"performed with ownCloud offline and no accesses being made. Online "
"migration is supported by ownCloud only when implementing industry-"
"standard clustering and high-availability solutions before ownCloud is "
"installed for the first time."

"To start, let us be specific about the use case. A configured ownCloud "
"instance runs reliably on one machine. For some reason (e.g. more "
"powerful machine is available, but a move to a clustered environment not "
"yet needed) the instance needs to be moved to a new machine. Depending on"
" the size of the ownCloud instance the migration might take several "
"hours. As a prerequisite it is assumed that the end users reach the "
"ownCloud instance via a virtual hostname (a ``CNAME`` record in DNS) "
"which can be pointed at the new location. It is also assumed that the "
"authentication method (e.g. LDAP) remains the same after the migration."

"Set up the new machine with your desired Linux distribution. At this "
