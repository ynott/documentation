"Using your :doc:`Linux package manager <package_upgrade>` with our "
"official ownCloud repositories. This is the recommended method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../maintenance/upgrade.rst:9
msgid ""
"With the :doc:`Updater App <update>` (Server Edition only). Recommended "
"for shared hosters, and for users who want an easy way to track different"
" release channels. (It is not available and not supported on the "
"Enterprise edition.)"

":doc:`Manually upgrading <manual_upgrade>` with the ownCloud ``.tar`` "
"archive from `owncloud.org/install/`_."

#: ../../maintenance/upgrade.rst:15
msgid ""
"Manually upgrading is also an option for users on shared hosting; "
"download and unpack the ownCloud tarball to your PC. Delete your existing"
" ownCloud files, except ``data/`` and ``config/`` files, on your hosting "
"account. Then transfer the new ownCloud files to your hosting account, "
"again preserving your existing ``data/`` and ``config/`` files."

"Enterprise customers will use their Enterprise software repositories to "

"information."

"When upgrading from oC 9.0 to 9.1 with existing Calendars or Adressbooks "

"**It is best to keep your ownCloud server upgraded regularly**, and to "
"install all point releases and major releases without skipping any of "
"them, as skipping releases increases the risk of errors. Major releases "
"are 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 9.0. Point releases are intermediate releases for "
"each major release. For example, 8.0.9 and 8.1.3 are point releases. "

"**Downgrading is not supported** and risks corrupting your data! If you "
