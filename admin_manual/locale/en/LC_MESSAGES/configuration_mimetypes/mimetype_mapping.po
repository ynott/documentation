"ownCloud allows administrators to specify the mapping of a file extension"
" to a mimetype. For example files ending in ``mp3`` map to "
"``audio/mpeg``. Which then in turn allows ownCloud to show the audio "
"icon."

"By default ownCloud comes with ``mimetypemapping.dist.json``. This is a "
"simple json array. Administrators should not update this file as it will "
"get replaced on upgrades of ownCloud. Instead the file "
"``mimetypemapping.json`` should be created and modified, this file has "
"precedence over the shipped file."
