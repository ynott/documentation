"ownCloud in object store mode expects exclusive access to the object "

"The current implementation is incompatible with any app that uses direct "
"file I/O and circumvents the ownCloud virtual filesystem. That includes "
"Encryption and Gallery. Gallery stores thumbnails directly in the "
"filesystem, and Encryption causes severe overhead because key files need "
"to be fetched in addition to any requested file."
