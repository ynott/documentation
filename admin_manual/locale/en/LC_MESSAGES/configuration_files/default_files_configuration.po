"You may distribute a set of default files and folders to all users by "
"placing them in the :file:`owncloud/core/skeleton` directory on your "
"ownCloud server. These files appear only to new users after their initial"
" login, and existing users will not see files that are added to this "
"directory after their first login. The files in the :file:`skeleton` "
"directory are copied into the users' data directories, so they may change"
" and delete the files without affecting the originals."
