"What Transactional File locking is not for: it is not for preventing "
"collisions in collaborative document editing (see "
":doc:`collaborative_documents_configuration` to learn about collaboration"
" with the Documents app), nor will it prevent multiple users from editing"
" the same document, or give notice that other users are working on the "
"same document. Multiple users can open and edit a file at the same time "
"and Transactional File locking does not prevent this. Rather, it prevents"
" simultaneous file saving."

"Transactional file locking is in ownCloud core, and replaces the old File"
