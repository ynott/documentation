"ownCloud storage backends accept one or more authentication schemes such "
"as passwords, OAuth, or token-based, to name a few examples. Each "
"authentication scheme may be implemented by multiple authentication "
"mechanisms. Different mechanisms require different configuration "
"parameters, depending on their behaviour."

"The **None** authentication mechanism requires no configuration "
"parameters, and is used when a backend requires no authentication."

msgid ""
"The **Built-in** authentication mechanism itself requires no "
"configuration parameters, but is used as a placeholder for legacy "
"storages that have not been migrated to the new system and do not take "
"advantage of generic authentication mechanisms. The authentication "
"parameters are provided directly by the backend."

"The **Username and password** mechanism requires a manually-defined "
"username and password. These get passed directly to the backend."

"The **Log-in credentials, save in session** mechanism uses the ownCloud "
"login credentials of the user to connect to the storage. These are not "
"stored anywhere on the server, but rather in the user session, giving "
"increased security. The drawbacks are that sharing is disabled when this "
"mechanism is in use, as ownCloud has no access to the storage "
"credentials, and background file scanning does not work."

"There is a workaround that allows background file scanning when using "
"**Log-in credentials, save in session**, and that is using Ajax cron "
"mode. (See "
":doc:`../../configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration`.) Be "
"aware that the Ajax cron mode is triggered by browsing the ownCloud Web "
"GUI."

"Currently only the RSA mechanism is implemented, where a public/private "
"keypair is generated by ownCloud and the public half shown in the GUI. "
"The keys are generated in the SSH format, and are currently 1024 bits in "
"length. Keys can be regenerated with a button in the GUI."

"OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 are both implemented, but currently limited to "
"the Dropbox and Google Drive backends respectively. These mechanisms "
"require additional configuration at the service provider, where an app ID"
" and app secret are provided and then entered into ownCloud. Then "
"ownCloud can perform an authentication request, establishing the storage "
"connection."
